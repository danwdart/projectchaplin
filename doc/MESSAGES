We use the AMQP protocol for messaging.
If you wish to use a callback (e.g. have Chaplin hit a POST endpoint for you) then please request this.

USING ANQP

To listen to events, such as "video uploaded", "video finished converting", and any others,
connect to the AMQP server located at the address of the Chaplin instance (or wherever else you have configured this).
The default settings are:

Host: localhost
Port: 5672
Username: guest
Password: guest

EXCHANGES

The only currently supported exchange is named "Video". It is a topic exchange with default flags.

QUEUES

You can create a queue by listening to any of the following binding keys:

video.encode.*
    for all video start-encoding (when a video is uploaded)

video.encode.[username]
    to restrict by username

BODY
The body of the messages are encoded as JSON and are as follows:
{
    "MessageClass": "Chaplin_Message_Video_Convert",
    "VideoId": "[Video Id]"
}

CHANGES
If you require changes, create an issue about it and it will be considered if it does not break any existing scheme.
